## Project: Study Buddy

> We intend to build a tool that would be a solo place where students would be able to track the upcoming assignments, class tasks in an easy way . This tool allows students to even check for updates in the calendar about upcoming to-do lists, memo functionality. This tool will also provide the flexibility for the students to customize the look of the application based on their own choice of themes.
